Utilitarian Numbers: Structural Analysis of Finite Elements
UNSAFE

Does what it says on the box.
The goal: to simulate both rigid and compliant finite element problems in
an environment built from scratch.

First features:
UNSAFE-R:
- Import utility for loading rigid trusses and forces/constraints on their members
- Fast matrix-based solution of rigid member forces
- Visual representation of system and member forces

UNSAFE-R3:
- 3d rigid member solutions
- Isometric/(perspective?) visual output of solution

Full UNSAFE:
- Steady-state solution for compliant members under the given forces.
- Dynamic responses? Gotta check in with Ted sometime :)
